# Kaggle Competition Submission


This project was done as a final for my graduate data science course. At the time of submission it scored 146/2124 so top 7%. I submitted and left it for
around a month, in that time someone made a really impressive LGBM that performed better public, so at the final the model was around middle of the pack.
This model placed higher than any of the other students in the class. It took around a week of constant training to get the best performing weights.
